# What's the difference between editors and IDEs?

IDEs contain text editors but many text editors, for example Word, do not include IDE features.

Many text editors such as Vim or Emacs have IDE features by default but then can be further customized to add file trees, syntax highlighting,

line numbers and syntax checking that is commonly found in full-featured IDEs.
