## What is the mind set ?

the mind set is a way to develop yourself in a good way throgh **prseverance** and **effort**
and it's a way to tell you theri's no one stupid in this world you just don't know how to do it in a better way 

like when you faced with challenges What should you do?
- [ ] avoid
- [x] embraces

ofcource you need to embraces because the challenges *make you a better version from who you are* 

and if i faced with criticism i will I will learn from it 

and if i saw someone succeed more than me i will be inspired not to take it as a threat.

So this is the ***Mindset***
